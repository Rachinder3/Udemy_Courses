ML: 

turning things(data) to numbers and finding patterns within them




Why use ML (DL)


reason: For a complex problem, its not possible for us to think of all the rules.
On the other hand computers are powerfull enough to do this for us.



Dont use ML, if you dont need to and use case can be solved with simple rule based systems.



google ML handbook:  https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml




Where DL fails:

1) Black Box

2) When traditional approach is better option

3) When errors are unacceptable

4) When you dont have much data :  will see how to circumvent this




ML: works on structured data
DL: generally used for unstructured data
